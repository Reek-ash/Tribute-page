        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <img src="./img/images4.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
          Lata Mangeshkar was a legendary Indian playback singer who was widely regarded as one of the greatest and most versatile singers in the history of Indian cinema. Born on September 28, 1929, in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India, Lata Mangeshkar grew up in a family that was deeply involved in music. Her father, Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, was a renowned classical singer and theater actor, and her mother, Shevanti, was also a trained classical singer.

From a young age, Lata Mangeshkar showed a keen interest in music and began to train in classical music under her father's guidance. She also started to perform on stage alongside her father and siblings, including her sister, Asha Bhosle, who would also go on to become a famous playback singer in her own right.

However, tragedy struck the family when Lata's father passed away when she was just 13 years old. This left the family in financial difficulties, and Lata had to take on the responsibility of providing for her family by singing in movies. She made her debut as a playback singer in the 1942 Marathi film "Kiti Hasaal" and later sang for Hindi films as well.

Lata Mangeshkar's talent soon caught the attention of music directors and filmmakers, and she quickly rose to prominence as one of the most sought-after playback singers in the Indian film industry. Over the course of her long and illustrious career, Lata Mangeshkar has recorded over 30,000 songs in various languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, and Gujarati.

Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks in her early life, Lata Mangeshkar's dedication to music and her unparalleled talent helped her become one of the most iconic and influential figures in the history of Indian music.
